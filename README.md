# Speaker encoder for multispeaker TTS
This repo has a set of encoders that have been used in our ptBR-TTS experiments. They are:
* DeepSpeaker: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02304.
* GE2E speaker encoder (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10467), with the option to use resnet architecture rather than LSTM.
* A simple speaker encoder that uses the reference encoder as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09017 and speaker classification through a bottleneck layer.
